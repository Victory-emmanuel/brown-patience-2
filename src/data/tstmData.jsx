This particular one was an amazing reminder for me."

I’m still learning it, but that’s where l started the learning process from. The woman had to let her cheating husband go for God to fix her and fix their marriage. She really grew, as she went through God’s dealings with her. I think about her sometimes when it’s difficult for me to let something go. If Sierra (that’s her name) can do it, I can.”"

On one of the hopeless days, I was led by God’s Spirit to read a particular chapter of a book l had inherited from my sister. That particular chapter addressed my situation at the time and literally spoke to my soul, reassuring me that there are lots of feats to attain whether situations around seem like it or not. In tears, I kept reading till my whole being accepted the message of the book. That book was ‘Break Out’ by Joel Osteen.”"

Yeah, I was confused quite alright; confused because I was letting my emotions take the lead. I knew what God had told me to do but it didn’t add up. Instead of walking in faith, I succumbed to despair. It morphed into other things and sank me into a pit so deep l believed I wouldn’t even be able to describe it. Reading that book helped me make sense of the chaos. It also encouraged me to turn back to and stand firm in faith. As Joe said in one chapter, God knows what’s best for me. It’s alright to trust, and follow.”"

One of her books is titled ‘The Masterpiece’. I learned quite a lot from it. Grace, one of the main characters, had a tough life. I could relate to that. But it didn’t shake her faith in God, not at all. I also learned assertiveness from her. Before reading the book, I would see something I didn’t like and I still wouldn’t say anything. But I learned to stand against things that don’t align to my values.”"
