                    This package is where I get to coach you stage by stage on
                    how to write your book. You'll be gaining two things: you'll
                    be learning to write better while authoring your book at the
                    same time. I'm an author, ghostwriter, editor, and a writing
                    coach. These mean I know how to write. I know how to write
                    for people. I know how to enrich what people have written.
                    And I sure know how to help you write (by yourself!) what
                    you need to write.

                    Every book on the earth has a purpose. Yours does too. And
                    that's where we'll begin — by defining your book's purpose,
                    zeroing in on its audience, and answering the big question:
                    Why? Why are you writing this book? What do you want your
                    reader to take away from it?

              That, you see, is what this Coaching for Authors package is about.
              I'll be the person that helps you share your message, the one that
              helps you tell your story — so your readers will hear precisely
              what you've been wanting them to hear, the message that's been
              burning in your heart. I got this vision from an author named
              Luke. The guy was a meticulous physician who brought that very
              care to his writing. Right from the start of the book, he stated
              its purpose. His reader was named Theophilus. And this author
              wanted Theophilus to know the truth. So he wrote chapter after
              chapter, explaining in gripping detail, employing the kind of
              storytelling that renders you immersed. Everything drove towards
              that goal — so Theophilus would know the truth. Centuries later,
              we're also learning the truth from the book Luke wrote.
            </p>
            <p className="my-6 font-medium  ss:text-lg text-secondary text-left xx:text-base">
              That's what books do; they embody truth. In the kind of format
              that lasts forever. Long after the author has breathed their last,
              the truth lives on. Do you know why you're so drawn to write this
              book? Because people need this truth—the very one beating in your
              chest; the one making you interested in this package. It's also
              why I'll help you. You're Luke, writing to your Theophilus. I'll
              be your helpmeet. I'll be the one who ensures Theophilus hears
              precisely what Luke wants to say.

                  We start by talking about the Big W's? Why are you writing
                  this book? Where did the drive to write it come from? Who are
                  you writing to? What do you want your reader to take away from
                  it? We could do this over a call, emails, or via chats. <br />
                  There are H questions too: How far have you gone with the book
                  or the planning of the book? How best do you think I can help
                  you through this writing phase?

                  After I've understood your passion for the book, you and I
                  will draw out an outline that works with your schedule (to be
                  frank, you might need to make your schedule work with the
                  outline or you may never find the time).

                <li className="ml-6 mb-4">
                  You begin writing. And you send a chapter (or more) a week.

                <li className="ml-6 mb-4">
                  As you send me the chapters, we talk about it. I tell you what
                  I noticed, if it's all good or how much better it can get, how
                  you can modify things, how to stick to appropriate tenses,
                  punctuations, where a subtopic is necessary, where an
                  illustration would aid understanding, and the repeated things
                  that must be cut out. <br /> As your editor, I would have done
                  these for you, but this Coaching package ensures you learn to
                  do them yourself, so you can grow more confident in your
                  writing and attack your subsequent writing or books with
                  experience and more knowledge.

                    important that you keep expanding on it. Thing is: When you
                    'start' writing, beautiful things happen. And I'll fan the
                    flame; I'll encourage you to ease up on the outline and
                    allow yourself just write. Thoughts, when they're given
                    expression, grow. You'll be amazed at the things flowing out
