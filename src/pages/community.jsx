                  Pornography found me early in primary school. Primary school
                  is that time when you're around 10 years old. Yeah, that's
                  when pornography found me. Or maybe I found it. And it held me
                  tight till I turned to Jesus at 15. But turning to Jesus
                  didn't give me a mind wipe. All the porn stored in my mind, my
                  memory, did not disappear. So though I stopped watching more
                  porn videos, my mind still had its memories, its archive. It
                  still knew how to create its own series, to make its own
                  fantasies. Even though I was now a Believer.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-6 font-medium  lg:text-lg text-primary lg:text-left md:text-lg md:text-center">
                  I didn't know how to stop them, how to quit thinking dirty,
                  pulse-increasing thoughts! And I was desperate to be free. “Oh
                  God, will I think these kinds of thoughts forever?”
                </p>
                <p className="mb-6 font-medium  lg:text-lg text-primary lg:text-left md:text-lg md:text-center">
                  Hell no! He taught me to tell them “No!” It's what His Word
                  said He'd do in Titus 2:11 & 12 — literally, word for word!
                  “For the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to
                  all people. It TEACHES us to say 'No' to ungodliness and
                  worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and
                  godly lives in this present age. . .”

                  That's precisely what the Holy Spirit taught me to do — to
                  tell ungodly thoughts “No!” to take control of my thoughts, to
                  have my mind renewed by His Word. And He can teach you too!
                  Oh, He can make you free. So free that you'd struggle to
                  remember what used to be compulsions.

                  Totally without planning to, I chronicled my experience in the
                  book So He Taught Me 'No'. “Weren't you ashamed to write about
                  these things?” Not one bit! Cause it's so much more important
                  to have my freedom replicated in the lives of my brothers and
                  sisters in Christ than to present a perfect image of myself.

                  And that's how the Oasis came about. <br /> An Oasis, by
                  definition, is a body of water in a desert. God's Word is an
                  Oasis. It refreshes. It washes clean. No matter the dirt our
                  minds have been covered in, no matter the level of vile in our
                  thoughts, no matter the depth of our addictions, God's Word
                  can wash that mind so clean, make it so new that its past
                  becomes a fading memory.
