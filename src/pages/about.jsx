                Where It Began For

              <p className="mb-6 font-light text-secondary md:text-lg dark:text-primary">
                Pornography found me early. In primary school. Primary school is
                that time when you're around 10 years old. Yeah, that's when
                pornography found me. Or maybe I found it. And it held me tight
                till I turned to Jesus at 15. But turning to Jesus didn't give
                me a mind wipe. All the porn stored in my mind, my memory, did
                not disappear. So though I stopped watching more porn videos, my
                mind still had its memories, its archive. It still knew how to
                create its own series, to make its own fantasies. Even though I
                was now a Believer.
                <br className="mb-6" />
                I didn't know how to stop them, how to quit thinking dirty,
                pulse-increasing thoughts! And I was desperate to be free. “Oh
                God, will I think these kinds of thoughts forever?”
                <br className="mb-6" />
                Hell no! He taught me to tell them “No!” It's what His Word said
                He'd do in Titus 2:11 & 12 — literally, word for word! “For the
                grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people.
                It TEACHES us to say ‘No’ to ungodliness and worldly passions,
                and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this
                present age. . .”
                <br className="mb-6" />
                That's precisely what the Holy Spirit taught me to do — to tell
                ungodly thoughts “No!” to take control of my thoughts, to have
                my mind renewed by His Word. And He can teach you too! Oh, He
                can make you free. So free that you'd struggle to remember what
                used to be compulsions.
                <br className="mb-6" />
                Totally without planning to, I chronicled my experience in the
                book So He Taught Me ‘No’. “Weren't you ashamed to write about
                these things?” Not one bit! Cause it's so much more important to
                have my freedom replicated in the lives of my brothers and
                sisters in Christ than to present a perfect image of myself.
                <br className="mb-6" />
                And that's how the Oasis came about. An Oasis, by definition, is
                a body of water in a desert. God's Word is an Oasis. It
                refreshes. It washes clean. No matter the dirt our minds have
                been covered in, no matter the level of vile in our thoughts, no
                matter the depth of our addictions, God's Word can wash that
                mind so clean, make it so new that its past becomes a fading
                memory.

                Brown has done most of her learning within books. It's why she
                knows—on a personal level—that words can heal, provoke, redirect
                and transform a person. Words have always drawn her. It's why
                she's s ghostwriter—to give your words the impact she knows
                words can have, to author soul-feeding salvation, one sentence
                after the other. It's why she encourages you to write the book
                you know you should, to share the message within you. An author,
                copywriter, story writing coach, ghostwriter, and editor, Brown
                lives within the realm of words. Books can save lives is an
                initiative born out of the passion to help people see just how
                impactful words have been in the lives of others. An initiative
                that encourages the reader to read, and the writer to write.
